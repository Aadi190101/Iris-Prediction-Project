# Iris-Prediction-Project
This project includes data collection, EDA, cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, data splitting, model training, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and model improvement through iteration and cross-validation.

**Overview**


*Use Case*: Commonly used for classification and pattern recognition.  

*Components*: 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica).  

**Features**  

The dataset contains the following features:  


Sepal Length (in cm)  

Sepal Width (in cm)  

Petal Length (in cm)  

Petal Width (in cm)  

**Classes**  

There are three classes, each representing a different species of Iris:  


Iris setosa  

Iris versicolor  

Iris virginica  

Each class has 50 samples.  


**Data Structure**  

The dataset is structured as follows:  


*Data*: A 2D numpy array of shape (150, 4), where each row represents a sample and each column represents a feature.  

*Target*: A 1D numpy array of shape (150,), containing the class labels (0, 1, 2).  

*Target Names*: An array of shape (3,) containing the names of the target classes.  

*Feature Names*: A list of the feature names.  

*Description*: A detailed description of the dataset.
